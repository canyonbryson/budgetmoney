Daily Reps is a day-to-day workout tracker that allows users to track the combined number of reps that one performs on a given day, resetting the logged reps for the following day.

This repository is the sample covered in the [**Build a daily workout tracker with Clerk, Convex, and Expo**](https://expo.dev/blog/build-a-daily-workout-tracker-with-clerk-convex-and-expo) on the Expo blog.

## Architecture

```

Expo (RN) app
‚îú‚îÄ Clerk (Expo SDK) ‚Üí user session
‚îú‚îÄ NativeWind (Tailwind classes)
‚îú‚îÄ i18next + expo-localization
‚îú‚îÄ Expo Notifications (device push token)
‚îú‚îÄ Plaid Link (RN SDK) ‚Üí link\_token from Convex ‚Üí public\_token
‚îÇ     ‚Ü≥ Convex Action exchange\_public\_token ‚Üí store Plaid access\_token
‚îî‚îÄ Convex client (queries/mutations) ‚Üê realtime data
‚îú‚îÄ HTTP Action: /webhooks/plaid  (SYNC\_UPDATES\_AVAILABLE ‚Üí /transactions/sync)
‚îú‚îÄ Actions: notify device via Expo Push
‚îî‚îÄ Tables: users, items, accounts, transactions, budgets, rules, profiles, plans, notifications

```

## Security & privacy

- **Server-only**: Plaid access tokens & cursors live in Convex env (never on device).
- **Webhook verify**: verify Plaid webhook signatures before processing.
- **Device**: use SecureStore for tokens/prefs; no plaintext secrets in AsyncStorage.
- **Data minimization**: store only what you render; redact logs.
