# AI Coding Guide — GroceryBudget

## 0) Ground rules
- TypeScript only; prefer functional React components.
- Expo + Expo Router + Convex + Clerk.
- Use **StyleSheet** (no NativeWind/Paper) for UI styles.
- No Plaid/AI in anonymous mode.
- Never store Plaid access tokens client-side.

## 1) Approach
1. Restate task.
2. Define constraints & edge cases.
3. Plan files + data flow.
4. Implement in small slices.
5. Self-check: types, auth/ownership, i18n, accessibility, performance.

## 2) Navigation
- Use Expo Router, routes under `app/`.

## 3) Convex
- Queries = read-only, no external I/O.
- Mutations = writes, no external I/O.
- Actions = external I/O (Plaid/OpenAI/etc).
- HTTP actions for webhooks.

## 4) Ownership
- All data scoped by `ownerType` and `ownerId`.
- Anonymous uses device ID.
- Signed-in uses Clerk user ID.

## 5) i18n
- Use `t(language, key)` for all UI strings.
